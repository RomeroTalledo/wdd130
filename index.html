            Hello! I'm Dallin, I'm 22 years old and I'm from Lima, Peru. I love playing video games, playing guitar, and watching soccer when I have free time. I'm currently studying Systems Engineering at BYU-Idaho, and I'm passionate about everything related to technology and programming. I really like going to the temple every week, as it helps me stay focused and at peace. I also really enjoy serving others, especially in the FSY program, where I get to help others and share special moments. I'm always looking for ways to learn and improve, both personally and professionally.
